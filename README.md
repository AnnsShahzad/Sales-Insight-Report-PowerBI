# PowerBI Sales Insights Data Analysis Project
## Phase-I: Recognizing the problem Statement
XYZ is the owner of a company. The company is working in different regions of the country like north, south, central etc. The owner is facing hard time to make certain decisions because he doesn’t has proper sales insights. 
	The owner calls different regional managers and they convince him that sales are good and everything is fine. But the owner has notice some decline in sales but he has no idea what is happening and why is this happening because the managers give him verbal insights and try to convince him that things are going fine, when in reality they are not. When the owner asks for proper proof about the sales, the managers send him excel files containing hundred thousand records of sale and the owner cannot review those excel files.
	The owner is so frustrated by all this and if the sales kept on decreasing the company may face extinction in near future. With all this frustration, one day he is at a get-together with his old college friends. One of his friend, ABC owns an IT company. XYZ consults his friend ABC on the matter of his company and how things been hard. ABC asks him to hire his IT Company for the data analysis. The way to visualize millions of records in form of graphs, charts to improve the understanding about how good or bad the company been doing and according to those insights the owner XYZ can take some proper actions to help increase company sales because when he gets to know what is actually causing the downfall of the company then he can act accordingly. Hence the problem statement is, “Visualize all the sales data of company over the years in an orderly manner to help understand how well or bad the company has performed and from those insights what actions need to be taken.”
